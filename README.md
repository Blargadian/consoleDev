Game Idea:
Top-Down, Isosymetric view
Based off of the show Breaking Bad.
Play as a character in a city collecting various items. These items alone are harmless and not worth any money
but combining items make them more valueable and illegal. cops roam around the streets and inspect the player, if the
player has illegal items on hand, the item is removed from inventory and player is fined. Other NPCs spawn randomly 
asking for these illegal items and will pay various amounts of money. Goal is to make as much money as possible without
getting caught.

Mechanics:
Single player or Co-op. In single player, the player can be caught x amount of times before the game ends. 
In Co-op, if one player is caught, the other player must save them before they can make money. If both players
are caught, the game is over.
